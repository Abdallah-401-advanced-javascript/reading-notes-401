 # Graphs
----------------------------------
 ## Graph:
  * A **Graph** is a non-linear data structure consisting of **nodes** and **edges**. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as **vertices** and the **edges** are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

 ## Terminology:
  1. **Vertex**: A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
  2. **Edge**: An edge is a connection between two nodes.
  3. **Neighbor**: The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
  4. **Degree**: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

 ## Undirected Graphs:
  * An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
  * The connection is bi-directional: When there are no “directions” given to point to specific vertices. .

 ## Directed Graphs (Digraph):
  * A Directed Graph "**Digraph**" is a graph where every edge is directed.
  * In **Digraph** has direction, each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.
 ##  Types of Graphs:
  1. Completed.
  2. Connected.
  3. Disconnected.
