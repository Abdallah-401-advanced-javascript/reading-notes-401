 # React Native
----------------------------------
 ## Native app development:
  * **Native app development** is the creation of software programs that run on specific devices and platforms.
  * **React Native** is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks.
  *  If you already know React, you still need to learn some React-Native-specific stuff, like the **native components**. 
  * `<Text>` is a Core Component that displays some text and `<View>` is like the `<div>` or `<span>`
  * Unlike **props** that are `read-only` and should not be modified, the **state** allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses and anything else.

 ## Responsive Web vs Native Apps: Which Is Better?
  * **Performance**: It is good to point out that native apps are able to use more resources and features of the device which means that they run faster and smoother. 
  * **Marketing abilities**: Generally speaking, responsive apps allow business owners to reach a wider audience on a wide range of platforms in a simple and easy way. This is something that you cannot expect from an average native app.
  * **Maintenance**: The truth is that native apps are usually more difficult to maintain once the app is downloaded. There are different code bases that must be maintained. On the other hand, when users are launching responsive apps they are always using the latest version. Native apps need manual update even though it is possible to set the mobile device to automatic update.
  * **Price**: It is a well-known fact that native apps cost more because developing an app like this requires more resources and more time.
  * **It is difficult to tell which option is better because it all depends on the nature of your business. Native apps allow the use of all the features mobile devices have like GPS, accelerometer, camera and other sophisticated features. Responsive apps are more cost-affordable and easy to maintain.**
 ## Expo:
  * **Expo** is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
