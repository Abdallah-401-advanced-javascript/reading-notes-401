# Express Routing & Connected API:-
----------------------------------

 ## Router: 
 * **Router** It is a mini express application without all the bells and whistles of an express application, just the routing stuff.
 * The **Router** allowed us to make our applications more modular and flexible than ever before by creating multiple instances of the Router and applying them accordingly.
 * Using `express.Router()` multiple times  allow us to define groups of routes
 * We can use route middleware to validate parameters using .param()

 ## Middleware:
 * Any functions that invoked by Express.js routing layer before your final request handler is made.
 * Have access to the request object ( req ), the response object ( res ), and the next function in the application's request-response cycle.
 * **Middleware** is a way to do something before a request is processed.
 * The order you place your middleware and routes is very important. Everything will happen in the order that they appear.
 ## Modularizing :
 * **Modularizing** ensures that external functionality is created in such a way that it isn't dependent on other external functionality, a concept known as loose coupling.
